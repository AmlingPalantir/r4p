canonical output order?
    several distinct JSON objects and no obvious way to pass down flag from r4p-main
    could wrap $fr into global context object that has it...
exit code?
    only really applicable to grep
executor: -A / -B / -C, --pre / --post
    err, --post implies some kind of ability to push more records

from-csv (once)
chain
    uh, oh, SIGPIPE from middle process closing input (e.g.  `head -n 1`)
    uh, oh, blocked write, e.g. something gross like `yes | r4p-chain yes`
        this is "legit" and should dump [inner] output forever
            obviously no one will write that, but the possible deadlock is real
        although I have no idea how to make backpressure work here (so we don't spool [outer] output forever)
