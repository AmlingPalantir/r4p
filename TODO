canonical output order?
    several distinct JSON objects and no obvious way to pass down flag from r4p-main
    could make global context object that has it...
exit code?
    only really applicable to grep
executor: -A / -B / -C, --pre / --post
    err, --post implies some kind of ability to push more records
help
tests
from-csv (once)

bof uncertain?
    not 100% clear it's desirable for things to act on it (window/multire) since it changes behaviour weirdly between chain and actual pipes
        could actually be a chain option, default to clear BOF between operations?
    current actual uses:
        window clumper clears window
        from-lines sets FILE
        from-multire clears state
        with-files sets FILE
