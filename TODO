canonical output order?
    several distinct JSON objects and no obvious way to pass down flag from r4p-main
to-ptable: --sort --x --y --v --p
"max record" (as in general record sort) aggregator?
exit code?
    only really applicable to grep
executor: -A / -B / -C, --pre / --post
    err, --post implies some kind of ability to push more records
help
from-csv (once)
