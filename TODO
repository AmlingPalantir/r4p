canonical output order?
    several distinct JSON objects and no obvious way to pass down flag from r4p-main
    could wrap $fr into global context object that has it...
to-ptable: --sort --x --y --v --p
"max record" (as in general record sort) aggregator?
    r4p-sort having a head/tail option (efficiently implemented) would let us hack this up with multiplex+sort
    or just separate head/tail operation?
exit code?
    only really applicable to grep
executor: -A / -B / -C, --pre / --post
    err, --post implies some kind of ability to push more records
